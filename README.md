# Ticket System

This is a test exam to be done as part of the recruitment processes at Net Tech International.

The test has a time to completion of **7 days** after the initial email is sent by one of our members.

### Test

The test consists of a basic **Ticket System** which includes the following modules:

1. Ticket Module (w/ CRUD)
2. Employee Module (w/ Login, and CRUD)
3. Report Module

The basic idea behind the application is that an Employee can log in and create/update/delete tickets and also create time entries for each of the tickets. Later, a report can be generated to get the hours worked by an employee during a time frame.

#### Sample Screens
